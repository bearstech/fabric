Changes in version 1.0.1
========================

.. note::
    This release also includes all applicable changes from the :doc:`0.9.5
    release </changes/0.9.5>`.

Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`301`: Fixed a bug in `~fabric.operations.local`'s behavior when
  ``capture=False`` and ``output.stdout`` (or ``.stderr``) was also ``False``.
  Thanks to Chris Rose for the catch.
* :issue:`311`: `~fabric.contrib.files.append` was supposed to have its
  ``partial`` kwarg's default flipped from ``True`` to ``False``. However, only
  the documentation was altered. This has been fixed. Thanks to Adam Ernst for
  bringing it to our attention.
* :issue:`312`: Tweak internal I/O related loops to prevent high CPU usage and
  poor screen-printing behavior on some systems. Thanks to Redmine user ``cbr
  grind`` for the initial patch.

Documentation
=============

* Added a missing entry for :ref:`env.path <env-path>` in the usage
  documentation.
